+Golems
++Golems reward chest's item are randomly placed in the chest

+Party Invite
++Make commands:
+++/party create (create a party (bound to a player? Ask ben))
+++/party invite <player> (only creator)
+++/party kick <player> (only creator)
+++/party list (list all players in your party)
+++/party accept <player> (player here is the team you want to join)

++Should the parties be preserved after a reload? (if so, can be added later)

++On server make GUI work with the new commands (only the inviting part? or creation of team to?)
+++(this has nothing to do with the plugin, codewise)
